      <h2>Stuff I Like</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="loves grid_7">
      <p>I love a good number of things, but to get the most points, I'll probably say that I love my girlfriend, Grace. We've been dating now for nearly five years, four of which were spent at different colleges 1,500 miles away from each other. Long distance has not been the easiest road, but we made it through! She's the best.</p>
      <p>I'm also a pretty big fan of trivia--You Don't Know Jack is my favorite trivia game. I like Kakuro, which is a number puzzle. Board games are awesome, be they party games like Funglish or Balderdash or strategy games like Settlers of Catan. Also, the old turn-based RPGs--Final Fantasy VII and Legend of Dragoon.

      <p>Grace has an adorable little Shih Tzu named Luna, who's totally not the only reason I'm dating Grace.</p>
      <p>Since I've been visiting home for Christmas, I've been spending an inordinate amount of time with Luna, and it's been great.</p>
      <p>Would Grace and I not be together if she didn't have Luna? Well, it would take some soul searching. Luckily, we don't need to walk down that road. </p>
      <p>Upon reflection, this blurb might not score me that many points after all.</p>

      <h2>Stuff Maybe Not Everyone Loves About Me</h2>
    </div>
    <div class = "quirk grid_7">
      <p>I really enjoy singing. If someone's talking, and they say a word that I know is a part of a song, I will usually just interrupt the conversation to sing a few lines of the song. Or, sometimes, I just like to make up songs about what's going on, desperately hoping that as I'm singing the line I'll find a way to make it rhyme. </p>
      <p>Now, when I say I enjoy singing, that doesn't mean I'm good at it. You would think with how often I sing, my voice would have eventually had to start sounding less jarring, but you would think incorrectly. So while I may enjoy singing, the people around me usually do not.</p>

      <h2>Who is this guy?</h2>
      <p>My name is Matthew, and I'm going to become a web developer. I studied Accounting in college, but one day decided to stop lying to myself and pretending that I liked it. I'm attending <a href="http://www.devbootcamp.com">Dev Bootcamp</a> San Francisco in January 2014 to learn Ruby on Rails. </p>
